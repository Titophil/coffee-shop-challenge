price (float, 1.0â€“10.0): Price of the coffee. Immutable after creation.

ðŸ§  Features
Enforces data integrity using custom type and value validations.

Establishes:

One-to-many relationship between Customer and Order.

One-to-many relationship between Coffee and Order.

Many-to-many relationship between Customer and Coffee via Order.

Supports aggregate calculations like total orders and average coffee price.

Identifies the most frequent customer for a specific coffee via Customer.most_aficionado(coffee).

âœ… Example Usage
from Customer import Customer
from Coffee import Coffee
from Order import Order

alice = Customer("Alice")
bob = Customer("Bob")

latte = Coffee("Latte")
espresso = Coffee("Espresso")

alice.create_order(latte, 5.0)
bob.create_order(latte, 6.0)
alice.create_order(espresso, 4.5)

print(latte.num_orders())  # 2
print(latte.average_price())  # 5.5
print(Customer.most_aficionado(latte))  # Alice or Bob (if tied)
